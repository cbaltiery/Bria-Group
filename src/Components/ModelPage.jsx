<h1>bria</h1>
<h4>The Botanical Research Institutes of America is an accrediting body and parent organization designed to foster the creation of botanical conservation programs across the United States.</h4>
<p>The BRIA model emphasized the creation of thriving local 'ecosystems of conservation' that connect and support: scientists, amateur naturalists, property owners, volunteers, workers, students and philanthropists. The model employs accreditation as an engine for growth and a rudder pointing the BRIA community toward a common goal: to save the biosphere.</p>

<p>BRIA's chapter structure supports rapid rollout in new communities, ordering a replicable, streamlined operating model. </p>

<p>Finally, BRIA supports the ongoing refinement of this operating model through a framework of rapid and creative prototyping, aggressive data capture and analysis, and a culture of supportive knowledge sharing. </p>

<h4>BRIA Naturlaists</h4>
<p>Earth's biosphere, still largely unexplored, is in peril. To complete the awesome work of documenting and preserving earth's incredible biodiversity, we need an army of naturlists in the field. BRIA is dedicated to bringing the emerging tools and resources of best-in-class botany and conservation to anyone willing to join the fight.</p>
<p>Level I and II accreditation requirements for novice naturlists are meaningful (requiring mastery of new conservation technology), yet easy to meet and welcoming to all. Advanced accreditation levels will require that Naturalist progress in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>BRIA coursework,</li>
    <li>activity in conservation projects and research, and</li>
    <li>service to their community.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Ultimately, the equivalent of a master's degree in botany or ecology will be offered through BRIA Naturalist accreditation.</h5>
<h6>10-Yr Goal: 13,000 BRIA Naturalists accredited</h6>

<h4>BRIA Gardens</h4>
<h5>BRIA offers the first accreditation in the United States for non-professional botanical gardens.</h5>
<p>A BRIA Botancial Research Garden is any public or private landscape dedicated to the mission and ideals of the Botanical Research Institutes of America. At every step of the way, BRIA Botanical Gardens practice good science with the best tools we can bring to you and your community</p>
<p>The accreditation ladder for BRIA Gardens will offer increasing levels of participation in conservation science and will integrate with accreditation requirements for BRIA Naturalists and BRIA Rountables. To reach the highest levels of accreditation, gardens will be required to participate in existing professional accreditation programs such as those found at Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) and arbnet, effectively serving as an accelerated feeder program for these mature conservation organizations.</p>
<h6>10-Yr Goal: 10,000 BRIA Gardens accredited</h6>

<h4>BRIA Rountables</h4>
<h5>What if we told you you could turn your entire city into a botanical research garden? </h5>
<p>A BRIA Roundtable is a group of BRIA gardens working together to make conservation botany an important part of the everyday life of their community.</p>
<p>Rountables offer the foundational structure for BRIA's local operating model. Coupled with accreditation, they are BRIA's engine for growth. A level I Roundtable requires a membership of 9 gardens. Moving up their own accreditation ladder, Roundtable members acquire new skills in fundraising, community engagement, and organization.</p>
<p>The ultimate achievement for a roundtable? A full-fledged BRIA Botanical Research Institute right in their own community.</p>
<h6>10-Yr Goal: BRIA Roundtables established in 170 cities and towns</h6>
<h6>10-Yr Goal: $850M raised for plant conservation</h6>

<h4>BRIA Institutes</h4>
<p>A BRIA Botanical Research Institute is the ultimate goal for any community in  the United States. Because on a planet in crisis, world class botany should be happening everywhere.</p>
<p>BRIA Institutes are devoted to the goals and strategies for plant conservation set by national and global science organizations. They share the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A distributed campus with research happening in multiple locations, making botany truly accessible to all.</li>
    <li>Inclusion of the arts as an avenue for deep connection to the community.</li>
    <li>A culture of collaboration and a shared interest in the success of their sister Institutes nationwide.</li>
</ul>
    <p>BRIA Botanical Research Institutes are where conservation and community come together.</p>
    <h5>Accreditation starts in 2024.</h5>
    <h6>10-Yr Goal: 30 BRIA Institutes established</h6>
    <h6>10-Yr Goal: 650 scientists employed</h6>

<h5>OPERATING SYSTEMS</h5>
<h2>Accreditation</h2>
<p>The Botanical Research Institutes of America is, first and foremost, an accrediting body. Accreditation requirements for Naturalists, Gardens and Roundtables provide the levers necessary to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>create a healthy 'ecosystem of conservation' in any community, by addressing community building and fiscal health in a addition to good science;</li>
    <li>build a fondation fo hard science skillsand competencies at the individual and group level; and</li>
    <li>create meaningful connections between scientists, property owners, philanthropists and volunteers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Accreditation knits the BRIA framework together.</h4>
<p>For example, to climb their accreditation ladders,</p>
<ul>
    <li>a Naturalist must be assigned to an accredited Garden, or become a subject matter specialist for a Roundtable</li>
    <li>a Garden must join a Rountable, engage an accredited Naturalist, or join a new research project;</li>
    <li>a Rountable will need member Gardens and member Naturalists that have reached higher levels of accreditation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to help all BRIA members acquire the tools and skills they need to organize and implement botanical conservation work in their communities. Working closely with BRIA, a Rountable should be able to establish an accredited BRIA Botanical Research Institute in their community within 9 years.</p>

<h5>OPERATING SYSTEMS</h5>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>Today, participatory governance is made increasingly viable and effective via technologies that allow for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>efficient and equitable community decision-making,</li>
    <li>transparent finances and resource managment,</li>
    <li>wealth building and investment managed by local stakeholder communities, and</li>
    <li>an open, well-documented history of the develpment of governence structures and policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Botanical Research Institutes of America is dedicated to the principles of evolutionary distributed governance. While this will pose complex challenges in the development of legal certanty and risk managment, we look forward to co-creating a better shared future for all BRIA stakeholders...and for our planet.</p>

<h5>OPERATING SYSTEMS</h5>
<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>A "patreon" system for amateur naturalists. Enabling anyone to invest in a team of plant DNA collectors. Helping donors fund work that happens in their own back yards...</p>
<h4>At BRIA, we're creating a robust funding ecosystem.</h4>
<p>Diverse, creative and ethical funding mechanisms are key to building conservation-minded communities that last. At BRIA, we believe that human and ecological communities must mutually benefit from the bioeconomy.</p>
<p>For Example, our unexplored soil and plant microbiomes hold treasures for humanity. As large corporations seek the next medical breakthrough or bio-product, the focus is primarily on shareholder benefit. At BRIA, we believe a powerful new investment infrasctructure can instead be built around regenerative economics that are forward thinking and respect life on earth above all else. </p>
<p>At a local level, BRIA can help members find meaningful work right in their own community. A 15-year-old amateur naturalist may use the BRIA app to arrange weekly visits to three different BRIA gardens in his neighborhood to tend their pollinator beds. He schedules his visits with the garden owners, documents parental approval, uploads photos of his finished work and receives payment - all through the BRIA app. </p>
<p>Donors will be able to fund conservation work in their own communities, and will have access to real-time data on the projects that they choose to support. </p>
<h4>Future-focused funding strategies.</h4>
<p>At BRIA, we are preparing for game-changing technology that is currently just over the horizon.</p>
<p>For example, the urgent need for the careful, ethical collection of plant DNA cannot be understated...and it is woefully under-resourced. At the same time, trained field scientists can't find well paid work.</p>
<p>A blockchain-enabled plant DNA database can allow professional or amateur plant hunters to make their specimens available to university or nonprofit research scientists-for free-or to private researchers for a fee or commission on future income. Blockchain-driven smart contracts will make this process almost invisible to the plant collector. Private funders will be able to invest in individual field scientists, or in tranches of DNA from multiple collectors. Scientists will own and control their data, and be able to make a good living, while doing the vital work of documenting life on earth. </p>
<p>This scenario will become a reality in the not-too-distant future, as blockchain database storage and data mining becomes increasingly efficient and affordable. BRIA is preparing for a future where we teach an army of naturalists how to sustainably collect DNA, make it available to those who need it most, and fiercely protect fragile ecosystems and rare and endangered plants. </p>
